title:  "On providing feedbacks and positional numeral systems"
categories: miscellaneous

This past week at work I was helping a recently hired teammate to complete a task. At the end he asked me for feedback on how he had performed and on what he could improve.

I first mentioned how great of an attitude that was and that I was going to do some thinking and get back to him with some feedback later.

It was easy to highlight the things in which he did really well, but when it came to the most important part - mentioning on what he could focus on growing - I found myself lacking the point of view of a newly hired engineer in the team. You see, I've been working at the same company for about 3.5 years and I joined this team about 1 year ago. He on the other hand joined the company a few months ago only, so it's hard to properly consider how challenging it is to navigate through all the concepts and systems involved in the task from his perspective, because it's easy for me to take the knowledge involved for granted.

I did my best to put myself in his position and highlighted that he should take the growth feedback with a grain of salt because I'm biased to how much I may be taking for granted based on familiarity with the things necessary for executing the task.

And it's SO easy to take things for granted. The problem with biases is that it's nearly impossible to identify them, especially without significant energy and time reflecting on the matter at hand.

For example, I had never really considered how hard it must have been to introduce our current numeral system in medieval Europe. Have you?!

Consider this excerpt<sup>[1]</sup>:

> [...] with minor exceptions, Roman numerals do not change their meanings when they change their place. On the other hand Hindu-Arabic numerals do change their meaning when they change their place. Consider this question, what does ‘3’ mean? When we encounter 3 in 437 or in 3,145,872, it means two different things. It is not “just a 3!” In the first it means “thirty,” in the second “three million.”  
> A more extreme example is provided by the occurrences of 3 in 1,234,537, where it has two different meanings! This illustrates the distinctive feature of the use of Hindu-Arabic in representing numbers: their place notation.

The whole concept of positional notation is so native to us that it's hard for us to conceive the thought that it was once a completely foreign and disruptive notion!

From tallying numbers with sticks, to creating different symbols for larger groups of sticks to finally creating the system of Roman numerals, it was all-in-all pretty similar in the sense that each symbol always represented the same amount.

But then... to introduce the system in which the same symbol represents different amounts according to its position?!

It's a fascinating piece of History that I have never considered.

As the article mentions:

> Most history books gloss over the introduction of numbers, but a recent article explains that “the uptake of the new numerals was slow, problematic, and spasmodic.

And as most history books gloss over this fact, we take it for granted.

Our biases thrive on the forgotten and the unknown.
